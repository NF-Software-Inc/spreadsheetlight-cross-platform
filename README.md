This project is a fork of the [SpreadsheetLight library](https://spreadsheetlight.com/).

The purpose of this fork is to create a version of the library that runs on .NET Core and is also capable of running in cross-platform environments. The library uses System.Drawing.Common, which required some platform checks to ensure those code sections only run on Windows machines.

## Getting Started

These instuctions can be used to acquire and implement the library.

### Installation

To use this library either clone a copy of the repository or check out the [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SpreadsheetLight.Cross.Platform/)

### Usage
